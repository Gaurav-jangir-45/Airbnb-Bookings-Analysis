        "1. **Handling Missing Values** :\n",
        "\n",
        "* I addressed null values in critical columns such as **name**, **host_name**, and **reviews_per_month**. Missing values in the **name** and **host_name** columns were filled with 'Unknown' to ensure completeness, while **reviews_per_month** was set to 0, reflecting listings with no reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The last_review** column was converted to a datetime format, and missing dates were filled with the median date, representing a common review period.\n",

        "2. **Outlier Detection and Removal** :\n",
        "\n",
        "* I utilized box plots to visualize and detect outliers in the **price** and **minimum_nights** columns. Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and subsequently removed to enhance the quality of the dataset.\n",

        "3. **Feature Engineering** :\n",
        "\n",
        "* New features were created to enrich the dataset for analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        " *  A **number_of_bookings** column was derived from **availability_365** and **minimum_nights**.\n",
        "\n",
        " * A revenue column was calculated based on the **price**, **minimum_nights**, and **number_of_bookings**.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. **Engagement Category** :\n",
        "\n",
        " * I defined an **engagement_category** column based on **number_of_bookings**, **price**, and **reviews** to classify listings into 'Good Engagement' or 'Bad Engagement.' This segmentation aids in understanding which listings are performing better in terms of guest engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. **Seasonal Analysis** :\n",
        "\n",
        " * I extracted the month from the **last_review **column and created a **season column** based on the month. This classification allowed for a detailed analysis of booking trends across different seasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * By aggregating the **number of reviews** (as a proxy for bookings) and average\n",

        " 6. **Group Aggregations** :\n",
        "\n",
        " * The data was grouped by **neighbourhood_group** and **room_type** to identify **mean prices** and **total reviews**. This helped uncover which **neighborhoods** and **room types **offer the best value and have higher engagement levels.\n",

        "**Conclusion**\n",

        "This data wrangling process transformed the raw Airbnb dataset into a structured format suitable for in-depth analysis. By addressing missing values, removing outliers, creating new features, and conducting seasonal analyses, I developed valuable insights into guest behavior, pricing strategies, and seasonal trends. These findings can be instrumental for Airbnb hosts and stakeholders in making informed decisions to enhance user experience and maximize bookings.\n",
